# The RGB standard process

1. File an RGB change proposal (RCP) as a new issue in this repo, 
   briefly stating the purpose and essence of your idea.
2. Community discusses your proposal.
3. Once an RCP is implemented in the RGB codebase and released to the production,
   it is marked as 'active'.
4. Active RCPs concerning the same topic
   are packed by RGB maintainers into a proposed RGB standard and filed as PRs in this repository.
5. The editor of RGB standards reviews the PR, decides on the assigned standard number,
   and manages merge into the repository.

The editor (pt. 6) can't put into the standards anything, 
which is not a part of the RGB ecosystem in the production.
The editor's only responsibility is to provide stylistic editing to compose
the description of the system in production and active RCP into a streamlined document.

Dr Maxim Orlovsky is the current editor responsible for managing the set of the standards.

A new editor is appointed according to the governance process described in the RGB-4 standard.

All new standards must be provided by their authors under CC-BY or a more permissive license
(CC0, Unlicensed etc).
