# RGB Requests for comments

This repository lists documents (RFCs) on proposed changes to RGB protocol.

## Procedure

1. File an RGB change proposal (RCP) as a new issue in this repo, briefly stating the purpose and essence of your idea.
2. Community discusses your proposal.
3. RCPs concerning the same topic, which got support from the community, are packed by RGB maintainers into RFC and filed as PRs in this repository.
4. The PR is discussed with the community once again and merged.
5. Once an RFC is implemented in RGB codebase it is marked as 'active'.
6. A set of active RPCs, related to the same topics ("module"), are standardized into an RGB standard.
